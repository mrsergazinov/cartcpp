Description: This package implements an efficient CART model with C++ and Armadillo data structures and algorithms. 
The CART model is able to train on the data and output predictions. Additionally, the model can select a random subset of 
features at each split. Furthermore, the tree model has options for multiple stopping criteria such as maximum depth or 
minimum samples required to be a leaf node.
The package also implement a random forest algorithm. The random forest implementation has options for the number of 
estimators and the parameters for each estimator. Since random forests are easily parallelizable, the implementation has an 
option to run in parallel.
