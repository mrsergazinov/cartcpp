Description: This package offers an efficient implementation of CART model with Rcpp and  Rcpp Armadillo data
  structures and algorithms. The CART model is able to train on the data and output predictions.
  Additionally, the model is able to select a random subset of features at each split. Finally, the tree
  model also has options for multiple stopping criteria such as maximum depth or minimum samples
  required to be a leaf node.
